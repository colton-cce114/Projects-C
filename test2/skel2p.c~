/* Write a multiple concurrent process program that does the following
1. Prompts the user for the number of words to enter
   2. Prompts the user for each word and writes them into 
      a file named word.dat
   3. Determines how many words are > “too”
   4. Determines how many words are < “five”
   5. Outputs the total count for each group.

   The program should perform this task in the following way:
   Create a producer child that:
   1. Prompts the user for the number of words to enter
   2. Prompts the user for each word and writes them into a file
      named word.dat
   Create a consumer child that:
1.	For each value in the file
	a.	Determine if value > “too”
	b.	If the value > “too”, signals the parent with SIGUSR2
   Create a consumer child that:
1.	For each value in the file
	a.	Determines if value < “five”
	b.	If the value < “five”. signals the parent with SIGUSR1
   Create a parent that: 
   1. Creates children 1 - 3
   2. Pauses.
